"""Tone detection and generation for statue contact sensing.

This module implements the core contact detection system for the Missing Link
installation. Each statue generates a unique sine wave tone and listens for
tones from other statues to detect when humans form a chain between them.

Key Components:
- Tone Generation: Creates continuous sine waves at specific frequencies
- Tone Detection: Uses Goertzel algorithm for efficient frequency detection
- Link Tracking: Updates connection states based on detected tones

The Goertzel Algorithm:
The Goertzel algorithm is a digital signal processing technique that efficiently
detects the presence of a specific frequency in a signal. Unlike FFT which
calculates all frequencies, Goertzel only computes the frequencies of interest,
making it ideal for our single-tone detection needs.

Frequency Selection:
Tones are carefully chosen to be non-harmonic to avoid interference:
- EROS: 3000 Hz
- ELEKTRA: 7000 Hz
- SOPHIA: 9500 Hz
- ULTIMO: 13500 Hz
- ARIEL: 19500 Hz

Detection Thresholds:
- Link established: Signal level > 0.1 (10% of max)
- Link broken: Signal level < 0.1
- SNR typically > 30dB for reliable detection

    """Detect tones from other statues using the Goertzel algorithm.

    This function runs in a separate thread for each statue, continuously
    monitoring the audio input for tones from other statues. When a tone
    is detected above the threshold, it updates the link state.

    The detection process:
    1. Read audio samples from the input device
    2. Apply Goertzel algorithm to detect each target frequency
    3. Calculate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for reliability
    4. Update link state if detection threshold is crossed
    5. Update display metrics for visualization

        shutdown_event (threading.Event, optional): Signals thread shutdown

    Note:
        This function runs indefinitely until shutdown_event is set or
        an error occurs. It should be run in a daemon thread.
