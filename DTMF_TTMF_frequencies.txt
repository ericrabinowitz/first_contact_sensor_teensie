DTMF Dual Tone Multi-Frequency:
/*
A key press on a DTMF keypad means a combination of 𝑓1
 and 𝑓2
 (Dual Tone) frequencies are heard at the same time. 𝑓1
 (rows) and 𝑓2
 (columns) have four frequencies (Multi-Frequency) associated with them, although 1633Hz was only used in military phones. 𝑓2
 frequencies are slightly louder than 𝑓1
 frequencies to compensate for high-frequency roll off of voice audio systems.

Frequencies were selected so harmonics would not be interpreted as a fundamental frequency. 2nd harmonic of 697Hz is 1394Hz, which is midway between 1336Hz and 1477Hz. Harmonics of 𝑓1
 can not be intrepreted as a fundamental 𝑓2
 frequency.

The combination of 941Hz and 1209Hz means that the sum (2150Hz) and difference (268Hz) are heard at the same time. 697Hz and 1477Hz means 780Hz and 2174Hz. None of these can be intrepreted as 𝑓1
 or 𝑓2
 frequencies.

Adjacent 𝑓1
 and 𝑓2
 frequencies were selected to have a 21/19 ratio (1.10), which is slightly less than a whole tone (musical reference Music and Noise) and can vary no more than ±1.5% (or ±1.8% depending on sources) from their nominal frequency.

The range of human hearing is 20Hz to 20kHz, most sensitive at 2 to 4kHz and the normal voice range is about 200Hz to 3.5kHz. Need 8 frequencies for 16 keys within 1950's phone's 4kHz bandwidth.

Human speech is unable to produce the combined tones, so you could implement modes, where users could talk and use touch tones to cause the system to react (operator).

Theoretical Extension:
𝑓1 = 697, 770, 852, 941, 1040, 1149, 1270, 1404
𝑓2 = 1209, 1336, 1477, 1633, 1805, 1995, 2206, 2438


TTMF
/*
In order to avoid harmonics, the three frequencies comprising a TTMF tone may be chosen according to the following rules: (a) no frequency is a multiplier of another frequency; (b) the difference between any two frequencies is not equal to any of the frequencies; and (c) the sum of any three frequencies is not equal to any of the frequencies. Thus a permitted TTMF tone is a tone signal comprising, e.g., three frequencies such as ƒ1, ƒ6, and ƒ7 (as shown in the second column of Table 1)
